This repo contains code for [Concept Algebra for (Score-Based) Text-Controlled Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03693). 

* For binary concepts, we make a demo in `concept_algebra_demo.ipynb`. More experiments can be run using `binary_concept_pj.py`.
* For categorical concepts, we use style as an example, and implement concept algebra in `style_concept_pj.py`.
