This repo contains code for [Concept Algebra for (Score-Based) Text-Controlled Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03693). 

* For binary concepts, we show a demo in `concept_algebra_demo.ipynb`, as well as `binary_concept_pj.py`.
* for categorical concepts, we use style as an example, and implemented concept algebra in `style_concept_pj.py`.
